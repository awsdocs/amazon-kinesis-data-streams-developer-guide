# Monitoring the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Service with Amazon CloudWatch<a name="monitoring-with-cloudwatch"></a>

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and Amazon CloudWatch are integrated so that you can collect, view, and analyze CloudWatch metrics for your Kinesis data streams\. For example, to track shard usage, you can monitor the `IncomingBytes` and `OutgoingBytes` metrics and compare them to the number of shards in the stream\.

The metrics that you configure for your streams are automatically collected and pushed to CloudWatch every minute\. Metrics are archived for two weeks; after that period, the data is discarded\.

The following table describes basic stream\-level and enhanced shard\-level monitoring for Kinesis data streams\.


| Type | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Basic \(stream\-level\)  |  Stream\-level data is sent automatically every minute at no charge\.  | 
|  Enhanced \(shard\-level\)  |  Shard\-level data is sent every minute for an additional cost\. To get this level of data, you must specifically enable it for the stream using the [EnableEnhancedMonitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_EnableEnhancedMonitoring.html) operation\.  For information about pricing, see the [Amazon CloudWatch product page](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch)\.  | 

## Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Dimensions and Metrics<a name="kinesis-metrics"></a>

Kinesis Data Streams sends metrics to CloudWatch at two levels: the stream level and, optionally, the shard level\. Stream\-level metrics are for most common monitoring use cases in normal conditions\. Shard\-level metrics are for specific monitoring tasks, usually related to troubleshooting, and are enabled using the [EnableEnhancedMonitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_EnableEnhancedMonitoring.html) operation\. 

For an explanation of the statistics gathered from CloudWatch metrics, see [CloudWatch Statistics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Statistic) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

### Enhanced Shard\-level Metrics<a name="kinesis-metrics-shard"></a>

The `AWS/Kinesis` namespace includes the following shard\-level metrics\.

Kinesis sends the following shard\-level metrics to CloudWatch every minute\. Each metric dimension creates 1 CloudWatch metric and makes approximately 43,200 `PutMetricData` API calls per month\. These metrics are not enabled by default\. There is a charge for enhanced metrics emitted from Kinesis\. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) under the heading *Amazon CloudWatch Custom Metrics*\. The charges are given per shard per metric per month\.

### Dimensions for Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Metrics<a name="kinesis-metricdimensions"></a>


|  Dimension  |  Description  | 
| --- | --- | 
|  StreamName  |  The name of the Kinesis stream\. All available statistics are filtered by `StreamName`\.   | 

### Recommended Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Metrics<a name="kinesis-metric-use"></a>

Several Amazon Kinesis Data Streams metrics might be of particular interest to Kinesis Data Streams customers\. The following list provides recommended metrics and their uses\.


| Metric | Usage Notes | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `GetRecords.IteratorAgeMilliseconds`  |  Tracks the read position across all shards and consumers in the stream\. If an iterator's age passes 50% of the retention period \(by default, 24 hours, configurable up to 7 days\), there is risk for data loss due to record expiration\. We recommend that you use CloudWatch alarms on the Maximum statistic to alert you before this loss is a risk\. For an example scenario that uses this metric, see [Consumer Record Processing Falling Behind](troubleshooting-consumers.md#record-processing-falls-behind)\.  | 
|  `ReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded`  |  When your consumer\-side record processing is falling behind, it is sometimes difficult to know where the bottleneck is\. Use this metric to determine if your reads are being throttled due to exceeding your read throughput limits\. The most commonly used statistic for this metric is Average\.  | 
| WriteProvisionedThroughputExceeded | This is for the same purpose as the ReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded metric, but for the producer \(put\) side of the stream\. The most commonly used statistic for this metric is Average\. | 
| PutRecord\.Success, PutRecords\.Success | We recommend using CloudWatch alarms on the Average statistic to indicate when records are failing to the stream\. Choose one or both put types depending on what your producer uses\. If using the Kinesis Producer Library \(KPL\), use PutRecords\.Success\. | 
| GetRecords\.Success | We recommend using CloudWatch alarms on the Average statistic to indicate when records are failing from the stream\. | 

## Accessing Amazon CloudWatch Metrics for Kinesis Data Streams<a name="cloudwatch-metrics"></a>

You can monitor metrics for Kinesis Data Streams using the CloudWatch console, the command line, or the CloudWatch API\. The following procedures show you how to access metrics using these different methods\. 

**To access metrics using the CloudWatch console**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. On the navigation bar, choose a Region\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**\.

1. In the **CloudWatch Metrics by Category** pane, choose **Kinesis Metrics**\.

1. Click the relevant row to view the statistics for the specified **MetricName** and **StreamName**\. 

   **Note:** Most console statistic names match the corresponding CloudWatch metric names listed above, except for **Read Throughput** and **Write Throughput**\. These statistics are calculated over 5\-minute intervals: **Write Throughput** monitors the `IncomingBytes` CloudWatch metric, and **Read Throughput** monitors `GetRecords.Bytes`\.

1. \(Optional\) In the graph pane, select a statistic and a time period, and then create a CloudWatch alarm using these settings\.

**To access metrics using the AWS CLI**  
Use the [list\-metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/list-metrics.html) and [get\-metric\-statistics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/get-metric-statistics.html) commands\.

**To access metrics using the CloudWatch CLI**  
Use the [mon\-list\-metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/cli/cli-mon-list-metrics.html) and [mon\-get\-stats](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/cli/cli-mon-get-stats.html) commands\.

**To access metrics using the CloudWatch API**  
Use the [ListMetrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_ListMetrics.html) and [GetMetricStatistics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricStatistics.html) operations\.
