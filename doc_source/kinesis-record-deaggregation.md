# Using AWS Lambda with the Kinesis Producer Library<a name="kinesis-record-deaggregation"></a>

The [Kinesis Producer Library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-kpl.html) \(KPL\) aggregates small user\-formatted records into larger records up to 1 MiB to make better use of Amazon Kinesis Data Streams throughput\. While the KCL for Java supports deaggregating these records, you need to use a special module to deaggregate records when using AWS Lambda as the consumer of your streams\. You can obtain the necessary project code and instructions from GitHub at [Kinesis Producer Library Deaggregation Modules for AWS Lambda](https://github.com/awslabs/kinesis-deaggregation)\. The components in this project give you the ability to process KPL serialized data within AWS Lambda, in Java, Node\.js and Python\. These components can also be used as part of a [multi\-lang KCL application](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/master/amazon-kinesis-client-multilang/src/main/java/software/amazon/kinesis/multilang/package-info.java)\.
