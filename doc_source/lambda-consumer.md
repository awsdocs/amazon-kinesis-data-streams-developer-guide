# Developing Consumers Using AWS Lambda<a name="lambda-consumer"></a>

You can use an AWS Lambda function to process records in a data stream\. AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers\. It executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second\. You pay only for the compute time you consume\. There is no charge when your code is not running\. With AWS Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service, all with zero administration\. It runs your code on a high\-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging\.
