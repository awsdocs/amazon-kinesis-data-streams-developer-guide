# Managing Enhanced Fan\-Out Consumers with the AWS Management Console<a name="building-enhanced-consumers-console"></a>

Consumers that use *enhanced fan\-out* in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams can receive records from a data stream with dedicated throughput of up to 2 MiB of data per second per shard\.
